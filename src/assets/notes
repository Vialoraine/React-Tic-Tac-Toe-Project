<!-- 

Let’s recap what happens when a user clicks the top left square on your board to add an X to it:

 - Clicking on the upper left square runs the function that the button received as its onClick prop from the Square. The Square component received that function as its onSquareClick prop from the Board. The Board component defined that function directly in the JSX. It calls handleClick with an argument of 0.

 - handleClick uses the argument (0) to update the first element of the squares array from null to X.

 - The squares state of the Board component was updated, so the Board and all of its children re-render. This causes the value prop of the Square component with index 0 to change from null to X.
